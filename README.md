# C Programming Practice 

This repository contains basic C programs to understand fundamental concepts of the C language. It is divided into three sections:

##  C Basics

This section includes programs that cover:

- Printing output using `printf`
- Taking user input using `scanf`
- Using variables and data types
- Conditional statements (`if`, `if-else`, `switch`)
- Looping statements (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions and type casting

- ## ðŸ”¹ C Operators

This section demonstrates the usage of different types of operators:

- Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- Relational operators: `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`
- Logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
